There are two different granularity levels for the thermal simulation (block and grid), which imply different two generation processes.

The **block mode** associates one temperature value to each functional component. To this extent, the center temperature of the component is considered as the temperature of the component as a whole,
and each functional component is represented by a single network node.

The **grid mode** allows a finer granularity by dividing the floorplan into a regular grid of cells, with no dependency from the actual functionality of the components. The division in
cells is indeed based solely on the area of the floorplan and on the desired granularity and degree of accuracy. In this mode, the current flowing across each node and its voltage represent the
portion of power dissipation generated by the corresponding area of the floorplan and the temperature of the same area, respectively.

The below figure shows the general structure of these two different modes:

Example of electrical circuit equivalent model. The number of nodes of the RC network depends on the desired level of accuracy (top), i.e., block level mode (a) or grid level mode (b). The
RC network is decomposed in a lateral model (middle, representing heat transfers that occur within a layer) and a vertical model (bottom, that captures the heat spread across the package layers).
